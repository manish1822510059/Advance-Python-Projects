A contact book is a database used to store entries related to a personâ€™s contacts like a phone number, email address, etc. It is also known as the address book. In this article, Iâ€™ll walk you through how to create a contact book with Python.

Creating a contact book is a great project for someone who is at an intermediate level in Python. Somehow this follows the use of data structures and algorithms as we are going to add contacts to the book and find them using the personâ€™s name.

So, creating a contacts book in Python will help you show and improve your coding skills a lot. When creating a contacts book with Python, you need to design an algorithm that allows the user to record and find any personâ€™s details.

In this section, I will walk you through how to create a basic contacts book with the Python programming language to store and find contacts. With a few modifications, you can use it as a project where you can implement the same algorithm on a database like MySQL to store the contacts.

Now letâ€™s see how to design an algorithm to create a contact book with Python. Note that you can save more information other than just contact details by customizing the code below:
