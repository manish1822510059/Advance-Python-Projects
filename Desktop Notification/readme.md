## <h1 align="center"> ðŸ’¡ Desktop Notification with Python ðŸ’¡ </h1>

I am going to create a desktop notification app to get a reminder to rest after every hour. 
Your message and alert can be absolutely anything you want. You can have a list of things you need to do in the day, week or month, and
the reminder app will constantly remind you of the same.

For this task you need to install a Python library known as Plyer, which is used to access the hardware components of your system.
This library can be easily installed by using the pip command; 
pip install pyler.

Now letâ€™s see how to write a Python program to get desktop notifications:

notifications.py
